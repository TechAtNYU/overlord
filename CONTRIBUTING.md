# How to contribute

If you are submitting a pull request or pushing to one of our branches then we expect you to adhere to the styling guidelines. We utilize the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). For sublime you can install the packages:

- [Python PEP8 Autoformat](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20PEP8%20Autoformat)

Then when you run the Command-Shift-P in Sublime Text 3 you will see:

- `Python PEP8 Autoformat` -- run it and it will format your `.py` file depending on the PEP8 standard.
